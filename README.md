## Purpose

Khaopiak is a temporary, intermediary file storage system for transferring between two devices. It was designed
primarily with printing at hotel business centers in mind, but can cover a range of use cases from file transfers,
viewership verification, and sharing secrets.

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üñ®Ô∏è Use Case: Printing at hotel business centers</summary>

Hotel business centers often restrict printing to dedicated, shared desktops, resulting in two main options for printing
from a personal device:

<ul>
   <li>Connect personal hardware (ex. USB thumb drives) to shared equipment</li>
   <li>Upload files to a web-based intermediary for download</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal hardware</h3>

Connecting personal hardware may not always be an option, whether due to port restrictions (such as software
restrictions and the lack of a physical port) or the lack of a physical medium (i.e. cabling or drives). Shared devices
may also harbor malware, stealing files and potentially infecting connected devices.

<h3>Web-based portals</h3>

Logging into web-based portals such as Google Drive, Box, SharePoint, Proton Drive, and Dropbox requires inputting
personal login credentials and grants excessive access to files alongside additional services, such as email. When
passwords are shared, stolen credentials may lead to further compromise, such as enabling logon to financial accounts.

While these web-based services often provide shareable links, they are often too long or complicated to type, such as
this Google Drive share link:

<pre>https://docs.google.com/document/d/t9trB8lKoaB_kIRk6FeFltqm1TGdsCpKolHGwcpVKXPE</pre>

When end-users incorrectly type a character of these URLs, it is often difficult to identify the source of error. To
mitigate this issue, a link shortener can be used; however, it increases the probability of randomly stumbling upon
the document, involves an additional party, and may be predictable.

Shareable links often do not expire, allowing a threat actor to regain access after the initial download, such as
through browser history.

<h3>How Khaopiak helps</h3>

Khaopiak alleviates these issues through enabling the seamless end-to-end encryption of documents accessed through
easily-typed, one-time-use BIP39 mnemonics, such as:

<pre>orchard home picture movie only what believe onion physical defy hole among climb brand million edge anchor upgrade sand awake loop layer panther soda</pre>

This means that end-users need not reference a random character-by-character string, but known words they can quickly
type and remember the spelling of. As all words can be identified using their first three letters, Khaopiak can
automatically correct typos.

During this process, hardware manipulation is not required, users do not need to enter logon credentials besides a
unique, expiring mnemonic, and mnemonics cannot be reused to download the same upload.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>ü§ù Use Case: Secrets distribution</summary>

Khaopiak can be used to share secrets in an environment where communications integrity is guaranteed; however,
confidentiality is susceptible to compromise, such as communicating vocally in an open office, on the condition that the
secret is not of value immediate value.

This leverages Khaopiak's expiring mnemonics, thus if the intended receiver successfully downloads from the Khaopiak
server, it can be assumed that only they have it. The receiver can then communicate back to the sender to confirm
receipt and use the secret.

If the secret for transmission is of immediate value, two Khaopiak uploads can be used for secure transmission. First,
transmitting a secret of no immediate value: the client-side mnemonic for an intended upcoming transmission. If receipt
is confirmed by the intended recipient, that client-side mnemonic can then be used to encrypt the actual secret
client-side for upload to Khaopiak.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>‚úÖ Use Case: Confirmed file access</summary>

Expiring mnemonics enables confirmed file access through using the Khaopiak server's file existance checking. If
Khaopiak reports that a file exists, it has not yet been downloaded. If it reports that a file does not exist, it
implies that the file has already been downloaded or the file expired.

</details>

## Features

### For end-users

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üîí End-to-end encryption</summary>

A portion of the mnemonic is never transmitted over the internet and is used to encrypt the file before uploading,
allowing end-to-end encryption. As a result, confidentiality of the original file is protected as it is never made
available to intermediaries.

For all purposes of encryption at rest, Khaopiak uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with all clients
supporting [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/a/final) and
recommending [Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/d/final) when possible.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>‚åõ Expiring files</summary>

By default, all files uploaded to Khaopiak eventually expire. If an attempt is made to an expired file which has not
been deleted from the Khaopiak server, it will be immediately deleted and a response will be returned as if the file did
not exist.

Note: It is possible for a client to assume that a file existed based on the additional processing time required to
check whether the file expired.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üóÑÔ∏è Protected file metadata</summary>

File names and content types are included as part of the payload for encryption at both the client and server sides. As
a result, at rest, file content cannot be easily inferred.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üìè Configure mnemonic lengths</summary>

Mnemonics can range from 24 to 48 words where end-users can specify the amount of words for the client and server
independently. As a result, users can choose to increase encryption key lengths for more sensitive files for increased
assurance that data confidentiality is protected.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üòµ‚Äçüí´ File obscurity</summary>

End-users can specify a number of randomized padding bytes for appending to their data at both the client and server
levels, altering file sizes and helping obscure the identity of the original file that was uploaded. As a result, the
content clients upload to the Khaopiak server is always more than or equal to the amount bytes of the original file, and
the amount of bytes the download client receives is always more than or equal to the amount of bytes that was uploaded,
making it difficult to identify the original file (and thereby assume the original file's contents) based on strictly
file size.

</details>

### For administrators

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üîë Restrict access with Cloudflare Access</summary>

Cloudflare Zero Trust customers can optionally require authentication through Cloudflare Access as a self-hosted
application. Khaopiak will check for a `cf-access-authenticated-user-email` header containing a valid email. Cloudflare
prevents impersonating through stripping the header from client requests.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless deployment</summary>

Khaopiak is designed for deployment on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/),
leveraging [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) for file storage
and [Cloudflare Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/) for file expiry, allowing deployment and automated
scaling without having to maintain servers.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üí∞ Deploy for free</summary>

For small-scale users, Khaopiak can be deployed on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)'s free tier;
however, requires disabling Khaopiak's automated expiry-based deletion system as it
uses [Cloudflare Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/), a Workers Paid feature. However, automated file
deletion can still be accomplished through
using [Cloudflare R2's object lifecycle rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/object-lifecycles/) and
expired files will remain inaccessible to clients.

</details>

### For all

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üìñ Open source</summary>

Unlike commercially available products, Khaopiak is open source. Organizations and end-users need not go solely based on
product claims, but verify them through analyzing both code and infrastructure design. If a provider hosting a Khaopiak
server cannot be trusted, a private instance can quickly be deployed.

</details>

## Security considerations

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üîê Cryptographic strength of encryption algorithms</summary>

Khaopiak supports AES-CBC and AES-GCM as they are available through
the [SubtleCrypto interface of the Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto):

<ul>
   <li><strong>RSA-OAEP</strong> is supported and required when encrypting payloads to the server or requesting an encrypted response. It is not supported for at-rest storage as it is a public-key encryption system, where current guidelines recommend a minimum of 2048 key bits. To meet this, 192+ BIP39 words would be required, which is unreasonable for an end-user. While client developers may use it for client-side encryption, server-side mnemonic-based encryption/decryption with RSA-OAEP will not be offered.</li>
   <li><strong>AES-CTR</strong> is not supported as it is malleable, potentially allowing the meaning of the ciphertext to be changed.</li>
   <li><strong>AES-CBC</strong> is supported as a client-side encryption algorithm. While Khaopiak is generally not itself vulnerable to a padding oracle attack, client developers should be aware of the algorithm's vulnerability.</li>
   <li><strong>AES-GCM</strong> is supported as both a client and server-side encryption algorithm. AES-GCM provides authenticated encryption which helps authenticate the ciphertext. Additional design considerations are necessary when it is possible for a key and initialization vector (IV) may potentially be reused; however, Khaopiak generates a random key and IV for each upload.</li>
</ul>

The OpenSSL enc program does not support authenticated encryption modes. As a result, some clients may use AES-CBC
instead, such as uploading from the command line.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üí• Server-side collisions</summary>

Khaopiak does not generate guaranteed unique mnemonics. As a result, it is theoretically possible for a collision to
occur, which may enable accidental file overwriting or downloading of an alternate file. However, this case is extremely
improbable. Client-side encryption helps protect data confidentiality even in the presence of a server-side failure.
While it is possible for another collision, enabling decryption of the file, this is improbable.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>ü¶π Mnemonic theft</summary>

To conveniently use Khaopiak, the same portal should both accept a server mnemonic and a client mnemonic. However, the
client mnemonic could accidentally be sent to the server if entered incorrectly, compromising end-to-end encryption. A
portal may also be maliciously designed to explicitly capture client mnemonics.

To avoid mnemonic theft, an end-user should have a means of verifying the portal's legitimacy (such as through TLS
certificates). Further, the portal should have a clear means of distinguishing the client and server mnemonics, such as
using half of a combined mnemonic for each, or using a distinct wordlist for the client and server.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üßÆ User-specified entropy length</summary>

When a user specifies an entropy length of 160 or 224, Khaopiak pads the entropy to become 192 or 256 bits,
respectively, as AES only supports 128, 192, and 256-bit keys. As a result, while a longer-bit algorithm is used for
encryption, it does not inherently increase the level of security assurance as the padding is predictable.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üîé Stored hash of entropy</summary>

To locate the file in [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), the server generates a HMAC-SHA256 of the
entropy used for mnemonic generation. As a result, the hash acts as a heuristic for determining the original entropy,
and thereby the decryption key for server-side encryption; however, this is impractical due to the sheer number of
possible combinations. This risk is further mitigated through leveraging an HMAC with a secret key for the server. As a
result, even if entropy generated between two different Khaopiak servers are identical, the associated object key would
differ given a different secret key.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üõ†Ô∏è Tampering of server code</summary>

In the event that the Cloudflare Worker is compromised and maliciously altered, it is possible for a threat actor to
bypass server-side encryption and easily associate file upload and download clients, presenting an elevated security
risk. This is mitigated through the Khaopiak client natively not trusting the server and encrypting the file locally,
inclusive of file metadata, enabling end-to-end encryption such that even in the event of a server compromise, end-user
content remains protected. Further, end-users may elect for their client to insert randomized padding into the plaintext
prior to encrypting locally, obfuscating the payload's true size and thereby helping obscure the originally uploaded
file.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üìãÔ∏è Unauthorized access to server-side storage</summary>

If a threat actor obtains access to files in [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), they would have
access to files encrypted using AES-CBC, where the plaintext may be padded, and itself a padded ciphertext generated by
the client, which is not of immediate value without substantial computing resources and is generally infeasible. Through
using a publicly accessible server, additional obscurity is provided through mixing files between end users, making it
such that threat actors cannot easily differentiate between ciphertexts with valuable plaintexts.

If a threat actor lacks the ability to list files and only has the ability to download given an object key, they would
need a HMAC-SHA256 hash, and it is generally infeasible to brute-force checking hashes due to the sheer number of
possibilities. To generate a valid HMAC-SHA256 corresponding an object's key, a threat actor would require both the
server's secret and the entropy used to generate the server-side mnemonic. Given a threat actor has this information, it
would be easier to query the Khaopiak API rather than [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>ü¶† Alteration of client code</summary>

As with all end-to-end encrypted solutions, the integrity of the client is crucial for ensuring secure communications. A
maliciously altered client may send unencrypted data to a third party, generate cryptographically insecure entropy, or
record mnemonics without end-user knowledge.

The native, web-based client Khaopiak ships with works to mitigate these threats through recommending that browsers
verifying script and stylesheet integrity, rejecting certain attributes (such as in-line scripts and styles), upgrade
requests to secure HTTP when possible, and relying on no third party assets.

Additional mitigations are deployment-specific, such as enabling
the [Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dnssec-what-is-it-why-important-2019-03-05-en)
and configuring [certain response headers](#recommended-headers).

Despite these mitigations, the security of upload and download devices alongside the client's integrity remains the
primary concern to the usage of Khaopiak. Malicious browser extensions (or the browser itself) may alter the native
client's functions. Further, devices may trust untrustworthy certificates, compromising the confidentiality and
integrity benefits
[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/)
encryption provides.

The native Khaopiak client works to combat the risk of compromised download devices through rendering certain content
types, such as PDF files, in browser when possible instead of forcing the client to download them, which can help
prevent threat actors from acquiring downloaded files.

</details>

<details style="border: 1px solid; border-radius: 8px; padding: 8px; margin-top: 4px;">
<summary>üåé Dependency on third-party DNS resolvers</summary>

The native Khaopiak client relies on a [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)
query to retrieve a public key for the Khaopiak server, stored in text format. The web-based client retrieves DNS
records through employing a [DNS over HTTPS (DoH)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484) server; however, this
adds a party now capable of identifying the fact that a client is using a Khaopiak server with PKI and potentially have
the ability to alter the key.

The native Khaopiak client mitigates this risk through generating a BIP39 mnemonic of the public key's hash, making it
easier for end-users to visually verify it is correct. Further, end-users may elect to use multiple DNS resolvers for
cross-reference purposes and improve confidence in the public key's correctness.

As the public key is only used for PKI encryption to the Khaopiak server, the client remains dependent on the DNS server
configured for their browser or device to determine the internet location of the Khaopiak server, making it such that
alteration of the public key does not inherently lead to compromises in data confidentiality nor integrity. This is
further reinforced by Khaopiak's client-side mnemonics, providing end-to-end encryption even without leveraging PKI.
