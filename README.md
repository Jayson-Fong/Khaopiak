# Khaopiak

An account-less and end-to-end encrypted storage system leveraging Cloudflare Worker with OpenAPI 3.1 using [chanfana](https://github.com/cloudflare/chanfana) and [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).

## Get started

1. Sign up for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev). The free tier is more than enough for most use cases.
2. Clone this project and install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run `wrangler login` to login to your Cloudflare account in wrangler
4. Run `wrangler r2 bucket create khaopiak` to create a Cloudflare R2 bucket
5. Run `wrangler deploy` to publish the API to Cloudflare Workers

## Development

1. Run `wrangler dev` to start a local instance of the API.
2. Open `http://localhost:8787/` in your browser to see the Swagger interface where you can try the endpoints.
3. Changes made in the `src/` folder will automatically trigger the server to reload, you only need to refresh the Swagger interface.
